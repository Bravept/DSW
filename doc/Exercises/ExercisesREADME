"Sometimes you hit the jackpot and sometimes the jackpot hits you"

The four exercises.

The first three exercises have notes about them. i've made a folder inside docs with the name "exercises"

The forth exercise:

Fork our DSW code and create a test coin:

a: Brand it, name it, change all texts and logos like it would be a real coin for release on the market:

I called it QuestionIV - QIV, made a logo (QIVlogo.png on docs) - set the public adress to "Q" Max coins: 100 Million mining rewards 100.
i've changed the files "amount.cpp", "wallet.cpp", "bip38.cpp", "mastenode.cpp", "chainparams.cpp" "chainparamsbase.cpp"  and "bitcoinunits.cpp" with the coin info.
Also included a genesis block file in the docs folder


b: Choose the mining algorithm, rewards and collateral table, and explain your choices.
i didnt changed the mining algorithm in the code but i would choose the scrypt algorithm because is the most simple, advanced and environment friendly, also because being the most advanced
can ensure us a longer time service before becomes obsolete.
the rewards are 100 coins and the collateral are 10 coins or 10%, got this numbers through some other cases i've studied.

c: At last, setup some seeds (the minimal required to run the coin) and bootstrap the blockchain.
i've made 4 seeds but couldnt bootstrap the blockchain:
